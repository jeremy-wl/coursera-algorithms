Algorithms Course
============

The code I wrote in this repository includes most of the **implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms** from the [Algorithms Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms) as I went through the course.

## Projects:
5/5 programming assignments were finished along with this course

1. [Percolation](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/coursera-algorithms/tree/master/Week%201_1%20Union%20Find/Percolation)
2. [Randomized Queues and Deques](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/coursera-algorithms/tree/master/Week%202_1%20Stacks%20and%20Queues/Randomized_Queues_and_Deques)
3. [Collinear Points](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/coursera-algorithms/tree/master/Week%203_1%20Mergesort/Pattern_Recognition)
4. [8 Puzzle](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/coursera-algorithms/tree/master/Week%204_1%20Priority%20Queues/EightPuzzle)
5. [Kd-Trees](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/coursera-algorithms/tree/master/Week%205_2%20Geometric%20Applications%20of%20BSTs/Kd-Trees)
